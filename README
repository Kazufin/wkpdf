wkpdf is a command-line tool for converting HTML documents to PDF.

Although there are plenty of browsers available for Mac OS X, I could not find 
a command-line tool that allows for downloading a website and storing the 
rendered website as PDF. This was my motivation for creating wkpdf. The 
application uses Apple WebKit for rendering the HTML pages, thus the result 
should look similar to what you get when printing the webpage with Safari.
