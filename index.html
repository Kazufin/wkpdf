<h1>What is wkpdf</h1>

<p>
  wkpdf is a command line tool for rendering HTML to PDF using WebKit and RubyCocoa on Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>
  Although there are plenty of browsers available for Mac OS X, I could not find 
  a command-line tool that allows for downloading a website and storing the 
  rendered website as PDF. This was my motivation for creating wkpdf. The 
  application uses Apple WebKit for rendering the HTML pages, thus the result 
  should look similar to what you get when printing the webpage with Safari.
</p>

<p>
  Since wkpdf is based on the state-of-the-art WebKit HTML rendering framework, it provides high-quality web standard compliant HTML rendering with support for advanced CSS2/CSS3 styling.
</p>

<p>
  There are plenty of use cases for wkpdf. For example, you may use wkpdf for:

<ul>
  <li>Automated generation of reports, invoices, etc.</li>
  <li>Creation of high-quality PDf versions of documentation in HTML format</li>
  <li>Archiving of PDF snapshot of websites</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<p>
wkpdf is an open-source software project hosted at <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a>.
wkpdf is bundled as a Ruby Gem which means that it can be easily installed on Mac OS X 10.5.x and later using the following command:
<pre>
sudo gem install plessl-wkpdf --source http://gems.github.com
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you are a developer and you would like to extend wkpdf you can browse and clone wkpdf's git repository at: <a href="http://github.com/plessl/wkpdf/tree/master">http://github.com/plessl/wkpdf/tree/master</a>.
</p>



<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>


<p>The following command shows the basic usage of wkpdf. The content of the apple.com website is rendered to a file apple.pdf in the current directory.

<pre>
wkpdf --source http://www.apple.com --output apple.pdf
</pre>
</p>


<p>wkpdf supports many options that affect how a HTML page is rendered and allow for example to set the page size and orientation, select specific style-sheet media, ignore HTTP errors etc. You can get a brief decription of wkpdfs options with:

<pre>
wkpdf --help
</pre>
</p>

<p>The following example renders the apple.com website to a PDF document in A5 format in landscape orientation:

<pre>
wkpdf --source http://www.webkit.org --format A5 --landscape \
      --output webkit.pdf
</pre>
</p>

<p>Many websites provide specific CSS stylesheets for printing, which suppress superflous graphical elements in order to generate tidy printouts. If you want to render a website with all the graphical icing to exactly match the view in a browser, you can explicitly force the use of the CSS screen stylesheet and enable the printing of background images as in the following example:

<pre>
wkpdf --source http://www.slashdot.org --stylesheet-media screen \
      --print-background yes --output sd.pdf
</pre>
</p>

<p>The following example suppresses pagination that is, the whole Slashdot front page is rendered as a single PDF page that extends as needed to fit the whole content.

<pre>
wkpdf --source http://www.slashdot.org --stylesheet-media screen \
      --print-background yes --paginate no --output sd.pdf
</pre>
</p>
