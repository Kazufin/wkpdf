<h1>wkpdf</h1>

  Command line tool for rendering HTML to PDF using WebKit and RubyCocoa on Mac OS X

<p>
  Although there are plenty of browsers available for Mac OS X, I could not find 
  a command-line tool that allows for downloading a website and storing the 
  rendered website as PDF. This was my motivation for creating wkpdf. The 
  application uses Apple WebKit for rendering the HTML pages, thus the result 
  should look similar to what you get when printing the webpage with Safari.
